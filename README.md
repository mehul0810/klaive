Welcome to the Klaive GitHub repository. This is the core repository and heart of an ecosystem of active development. Here you can browse the source, look at open issues, and contribute to the project. 

Happy Coding!
 
 ## üôã Support
 
This repository is not suitable for WordPress admin or donor support. Please don't use GitHub issues for non-development related support requests. Don't get us wrong, we're more than happy to help you! However, to get the support you need please use the following channels:

* [WP.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/klaive) - for all users.
 
## üå± Getting Started 

If you're looking to contribute or actively develop on Klaive, welcome! We're glad you're here. Please ‚≠êÔ∏è this repository and fork it to begin local development. 

Most of us are using [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/) to develop on WordPress, which makes set up quick and easy. If you prefer [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), or another flavor of local development that's cool too!

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as JavaScript engine
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) npm command globally available in CLI
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) composer command globally available in CLI

## üíª Local Development 

To get started developing on the Klaive you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a new WordPress site with `klaive.test` as the URL
2. `cd` into your local plugins directory: `/path/to/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Fork this repository from GitHub and then clone that into your plugins directory in a new `klaive` directory
4. Run `composer install` to set up dependencies
5. Run `npm install` to get the necessary npm packages
6. Activate the plugin in WordPress
7. Run `npm run watch` to start the watch process which will build the sass and script files  

That's it. You're now ready to start development.

**Available commands**

| Command             | Description  |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| `npm run watch`      | Watch for changes and Build JS and SASS files. Typically you'll run this command before you start development. It's necessary to build the JS/CSS however if you're working strictly within PHP it may not be necessary to run.  |
| `npm run dev`      |    Runs a one time build for development. No production files are created. |
| `npm run production` |  Builds the minified production files for release. |

**Development Notes**

* Ensure that you have `SCRIPT_DEBUG` enabled within your wp-config.php file. Here's a good example of wp-config.php for debugging:
    ```
     // Enable WP_DEBUG mode
    define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
    
    // Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
    define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
   
    // Loads unminified core files
    define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
    ```
* Commit the `package.lock` file. Read more about why [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json). 
* Your editor should recognize the `.eslintrc` and `.editorconfig` files within the Repo's root directory. Please only submit PRs following those coding style rulesets.
